# Phase 28C Review Prompt: Translucent toolbar/buttons, z-index tokens, and topmost variable modal

## Environment

The default shell may use Node v16.17.0 at `/usr/local/bin/node`.

This project requires Node >=22.12.0.

Use:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Verification:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm test
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run build
```

Also run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Optional, only if the repository is already lint-clean:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run lint
```
## Project context

You are working on the StratifiedTikZ project.

Current public repository:

```text
https://github.com/T2sp/stratified-tikz
```

The editor already has mature core editing features:

- 2D and 3D diagrams;
- SVG/PGF Preview-centered editing;
- cursor and direct creation;
- coordinate anchors and coordinate references;
- symbolic variables;
- global and work-plane-local symbolic coordinates;
- cursor snapping;
- multi-selection and bulk editing;
- coordinate-anchor multi-selection/translation;
- symbolic-aware translation;
- path concatenation;
- path inline nodes and path splitting;
- style eyedropper;
- selection cycling;
- layer palette/window;
- custom work planes and camera/view controls;
- paths with arrows;
- 2D braiding/string-diagram crossings;
- grids/lattices;
- points, labels, paths, sheets, filled regions/sheets, ruled surfaces, Coons patches, and curved surfaces;
- style manager and imported TikZ style references;
- standalone and inline math TikZ export modes;
- 4-space TikZ indentation;
- inline math TikZ output with no blank lines;
- save/load;
- undo/redo.

Phase 28 is a preview-first UI, style shortcut, work-plane UX, SVG export, arrow-preview, and help/tutorial phase.

High-level design principles:

- SVG Preview is the main workspace.
- Reduce scrolling during editing.
- Reduce toolbar/palette calls during editing.
- Keep frequent style edits available from Preview toolbar shortcuts.
- Keep Inspector for detailed editing.
- Keep TikZ source/export readable and unchanged unless the user explicitly changes diagram/style data.
- UI-only state must not be saved into `Diagram`.
- Exported TikZ must keep 4-space indentation.
- Inline math output must contain no blank lines.
- Preserve save/load, undo/redo, coordinate anchors, coordinate refs, symbolic input, work-plane-local coordinates, layers, camera/view, arrows, braiding, path inline nodes/splitting, and existing geometry semantics.

Important user-specified UI requirements:

- SVG Preview height should expand to roughly 90% of the browser viewport.
- Example bar should not consume editing space; after editing begins it should collapse into a compact/dropdown control.
- Export SVG button should be sticky at the right-bottom below the Preview frame, protruding outside the frame.
- Toolbar background should be translucent.
- Toolbar buttons should also be translucent, but button text must remain fully opaque/readable.
- Load-JSON variable-resolution modal must appear above toolbar and all preview overlays.
- Coons direction window should auto-close when leaving Coons workflow or selecting other tools/subtools.
- 3D work-plane editor should be a Preview overlay near the left-bottom, similar in spirit to the current layer manager.
- 3D Add coordinate / Add point with active work-plane-local coordinates should support polar input in the work plane.
- Work-plane local polar input should show the active work-plane origin near the input.
- Work-plane setup UX should list methods in this order:
  1. Pick 3 existing points;
  2. Origin + normal vector;
  3. Custom 3 points.
- Origin + normal vector should use normal-vector theta/phi input with a small normal-vector preview.
- Arrow previews in SVG should look like the generated TikZ arrows, including `>`, `Stealth`, `Latex`, `Stealth[harpoon]`, and `Stealth[harpoon,swap]`.
- Context quick style bar should expose frequently changed style fields:
  - curve/path stroke color;
  - curve/path stroke width;
  - arrows;
  - point fill/color;
  - point radius;
  - sheet fill/opacity/stroke width;
  - label color/scale where applicable;
  - style eyedropper;
  - imported TikZ style dropdown if it does not clutter the toolbar.
- Stroke-width-like fields and point radius should use a snapped slider with step `0.1` plus custom numeric input.
- Numeric text inputs should allow temporary invalid drafts and show warnings instead of blocking intermediate input, so `.5`, `.`, `-`, `1e` can be typed.
- Imported TikZ styles in the shortcut bar should be compact/searchable and should avoid duplicating options in generated TikZ unless the user explicitly overrides a field.
## Review instructions

Review this subphase only.

Do not modify files.

At the end, output both:

1. a human-readable review;
2. a machine-readable JSON block between `REVIEW_JSON_START` and `REVIEW_JSON_END`.

If there are any Critical or Medium issues, set `"ready_to_commit": false`.

If only Low-priority issues remain, set `"ready_to_commit": true`.

Use this human-readable structure:

```markdown
**Summary:** pass / needs changes

**Critical Issues**
- ...

**Medium Issues**
- ...

**Low-Priority Issues**
- ...

**What Looks Correct**
- ...

**Test Results**
...

**Build Results**
...

**Ready To Call This Subphase Complete**
Yes/No, with a short reason.

**Suggested Targeted Follow-Up Prompt**
If needed, provide a concise fix prompt.
```

Then output exactly:

```text
REVIEW_JSON_START
{
  "summary": "pass or needs_changes",
  "critical_count": 0,
  "medium_count": 0,
  "low_count": 0,
  "ready_to_commit": true,
  "suggested_fix_prompt": ""
}
REVIEW_JSON_END
```

Rules:

- counts must be numbers;
- `summary` must be `"pass"` or `"needs_changes"`;
- `ready_to_commit` must be false if Critical or Medium issues exist;
- `suggested_fix_prompt` should be targeted if fixes are needed.


## Goal under review

Phase 28C should make toolbar/buttons translucent and fix modal stacking.

## Review checklist

Check:

- toolbar background translucent;
- button backgrounds translucent;
- button text not faded;
- no parent opacity causing unreadable controls;
- variable modal above all overlays;
- modal blocks toolbar interaction;
- z-index hierarchy clear;
- existing toolbar/layer/inspector behavior intact.

Medium issues include:

- text opacity reduced;
- modal still behind toolbar;
- pointer events leak through modal;
- toolbar becomes unreadable.

Run verification commands and report results.
