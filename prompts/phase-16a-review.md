# Phase 16A Review Prompt: Layer metadata and Layer Manager foundation

## Environment

The default shell may use Node v16.17.0 at `/usr/local/bin/node`.

This project requires Node >=22.12.0.

Use:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Verification:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm test
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run build
```


## Project context

You are working on the StratifiedTikZ project.

Phase 15 is complete. The editor has enough core geometry features to draw useful 2D/3D stratified diagrams.

Phase 16 focuses on a Layer Manager.

The app already has:

- layer values on strata and labels;
- layer-aware TikZ output;
- layer filtering;
- creation layer controls;
- selection;
- undo/redo;
- save/load;
- SVG preview;
- TikZ export;
- many geometric kinds:
  - points;
  - labels;
  - polylines;
  - cubic Béziers;
  - concatenated paths;
  - arc/circle/ellipse path templates if implemented;
  - polygon sheets;
  - filled regions;
  - work-plane-filled sheets;
  - curved sheet primitives such as hemispheres/saddles if implemented.

Important conventions:

- An `n`-stratum means codimension `n`, not dimension.
- Internally all coordinates are `Vec3`.
- In 2D, `z` is hidden/locked/ignored and should stay `0`.
- Layer metadata should be diagram data if it is part of saved/opened diagrams.
- Current selected layer filter and UI-expanded/collapsed state should remain UI/editor state.
- Layer operations that modify diagram elements must be undoable.
- Generated TikZ should preserve Phase 9B layer-aware output.
- Do not break save/load of older diagrams without explicit layer metadata.


## Review instructions

Review this subphase only.

Do not modify files.

At the end, output both:

1. a human-readable review;
2. a machine-readable JSON block between `REVIEW_JSON_START` and `REVIEW_JSON_END`.

If there are any Critical or Medium issues, set `"ready_to_commit": false`.

If only Low-priority issues remain, set `"ready_to_commit": true`.

Use this human-readable structure:

```markdown
**Summary:** pass / needs changes

**Critical Issues**
- ...

**Medium Issues**
- ...

**Low-Priority Issues**
- ...

**What Looks Correct**
- ...

**Test Results**
...

**Build Results**
...

**Ready To Call This Subphase Complete**
Yes/No, with a short reason.

**Suggested Targeted Follow-Up Prompt**
If needed, provide a concise fix prompt.
```

Then output exactly:

```text
REVIEW_JSON_START
{
  "summary": "pass or needs_changes",
  "critical_count": 0,
  "medium_count": 0,
  "low_count": 0,
  "ready_to_commit": true,
  "suggested_fix_prompt": ""
}
REVIEW_JSON_END
```

Rules:

- counts must be numbers;
- `summary` must be `"pass"` or `"needs_changes"`;
- `ready_to_commit` must be false if Critical or Medium issues exist;
- `suggested_fix_prompt` should be targeted if fixes are needed.


## Goal under review

Phase 16A should introduce diagram-level layer metadata and a basic Layer Manager panel without changing existing layer semantics.

## Review checklist

Check:

- layer metadata model exists;
- existing numeric `layer` fields remain the membership source;
- old diagrams without metadata still load;
- missing metadata derived from used layer values;
- layer names saved/loaded;
- duplicate layer metadata values handled safely;
- non-finite layer values rejected;
- blank names rejected or safely defaulted;
- Layer Manager shows layer values, names, and element counts;
- counts include strata and labels;
- UI expanded/collapsed state is not stored in `Diagram`;
- TikZ layer output unchanged by metadata-only changes;
- layer filter and creation layer not regressed.

Medium issues include:

- old diagrams fail to load;
- layer metadata changes element layer semantics;
- metadata stored as UI-only state but expected to persist;
- invalid metadata accepted;
- TikZ output broken.

Run verification commands and report results.
