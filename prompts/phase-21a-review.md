# Phase 21A Review Prompt: Preview-centered UI shell and layout foundation

## Environment

The default shell may use Node v16.17.0 at `/usr/local/bin/node`.

This project requires Node >=22.12.0.

Use:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Verification:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm test
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run build
```

Also run if available:

```bash
git diff --check
```
## Project context

You are working on the StratifiedTikZ project.

Phase 20 is complete.

The editor now supports:

- 2D and 3D diagrams;
- custom work planes;
- camera controls;
- layer manager;
- style manager and imported TikZ style references;
- standalone and inline math TikZ export modes;
- symbolic variables and coordinate expressions;
- grids;
- paths, filled regions/sheets, curved surfaces, ruled surfaces, Coons patches, and auto visibility;
- save/load;
- undo/redo;
- SVG preview;
- TikZ source generation.

Phase 21 is a major UI overhaul.

The attached reference mockup has the overall idea:

- compact top panels for Example/File/TikZ style/Variable editor/Work plane selector;
- a large SVG Preview area;
- a floating toolbar inside the top of SVG Preview;
- Undo/Redo as translucent preview-overlay buttons;
- compact Inspector/Layer/Camera buttons around the preview;
- TikZ Source below the preview area.

Important constraints:

- This is UI/layout work unless explicitly stated.
- Do not change diagram data model unless a UI state field truly must persist.
- Do not change TikZ generation semantics.
- Do not change SVG rendering geometry semantics.
- UI overlay state is editor/UI state, not `Diagram`.
- Preserve save/load, undo/redo, camera, work-plane, layer manager, style manager, symbolic input, grid, auto-visibility, and all geometry behavior.
## Review instructions

Review this subphase only.

Do not modify files.

At the end, output both:

1. a human-readable review;
2. a machine-readable JSON block between `REVIEW_JSON_START` and `REVIEW_JSON_END`.

If there are any Critical or Medium issues, set `"ready_to_commit": false`.

If only Low-priority issues remain, set `"ready_to_commit": true`.

Use this human-readable structure:

```markdown
**Summary:** pass / needs changes

**Critical Issues**
- ...

**Medium Issues**
- ...

**Low-Priority Issues**
- ...

**What Looks Correct**
- ...

**Test Results**
...

**Build Results**
...

**Ready To Call This Subphase Complete**
Yes/No, with a short reason.

**Suggested Targeted Follow-Up Prompt**
If needed, provide a concise fix prompt.
```

Then output exactly:

```text
REVIEW_JSON_START
{
  "summary": "pass or needs_changes",
  "critical_count": 0,
  "medium_count": 0,
  "low_count": 0,
  "ready_to_commit": true,
  "suggested_fix_prompt": ""
}
REVIEW_JSON_END
```

Rules:

- counts must be numbers;
- `summary` must be `"pass"` or `"needs_changes"`;
- `ready_to_commit` must be false if Critical or Medium issues exist;
- `suggested_fix_prompt` should be targeted if fixes are needed.


## Goal under review

Phase 21A should create a preview-centered layout foundation with a large SVG Preview and TikZ source below it.

## Review checklist

Check:

- SVG Preview is the dominant workspace;
- preview wrapper can host overlays;
- TikZ source appears below preview;
- top controls are compact;
- existing SVG pointer mapping works;
- camera/work-plane/source controls remain accessible;
- responsive layout usable;
- no model/TikZ/SVG semantic changes;
- save/load/undo/redo not regressed.

Medium issues include:

- preview becomes smaller/unusable;
- pointer mapping breaks;
- TikZ source no longer updates/copies;
- controls become inaccessible;
- layout state stored in diagram data.

Run verification commands and report results.
