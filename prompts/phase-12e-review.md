# Phase 12E Review Prompt: Custom work-plane preview and creation integration

## Environment

The default shell may use Node v16.17.0 at `/usr/local/bin/node`.

This project requires Node >=22.12.0.

Use:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Verification:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm test
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run build
```


## Project context

You are working on the StratifiedTikZ project.

Important conventions:

- An n-stratum means codimension n, not dimension.
- Internally all coordinates are `Vec3`.
- In 2D, `z` is hidden/locked/ignored and should stay `0`.
- Active work-plane state is editor/UI state, not `Diagram`.
- Work planes are drawing aids, not committed diagram elements.
- Geometry created on a work plane is committed as ordinary `Vec3` diagram data.
- Work-plane guides/previews must not be exported to TikZ.
- Generated TikZ should not depend on transient active UI state.
- Existing axis-aligned 3D work planes (`xy`, `xz`, `yz`) must keep working.
- Preserve Phase 9A coordinate naming and Phase 9B layer-aware TikZ output.


## Review instructions

Review this subphase only.

Do not modify files.

At the end, output both:

1. a human-readable review;
2. a machine-readable JSON block between `REVIEW_JSON_START` and `REVIEW_JSON_END`.

If there are any Critical or Medium issues, set `"ready_to_commit": false`.
If only Low-priority issues remain, set `"ready_to_commit": true`.

Output format:

```markdown
**Summary:** pass / needs changes

**Critical Issues**
- ...

**Medium Issues**
- ...

**Low-Priority Issues**
- ...

**What Looks Correct**
- ...

**Test Results**
...

**Build Results**
...

**Ready To Call This Subphase Complete**
Yes/No, with a short reason.

**Suggested Targeted Follow-Up Prompt**
If needed, provide a concise fix prompt.
```

Then output:

```text
REVIEW_JSON_START
{
  "summary": "pass or needs_changes",
  "critical_count": 0,
  "medium_count": 0,
  "low_count": 0,
  "ready_to_commit": true,
  "suggested_fix_prompt": ""
}
REVIEW_JSON_END
```

Rules:

- counts must be numbers;
- `ready_to_commit` must be false if Critical or Medium issues exist;
- `suggested_fix_prompt` should be targeted if fixes are needed.


## Goal under review

Render custom work-plane previews and ensure cursor creation works on active custom planes.

## Review checklist

Check:

- custom plane preview is visible in 3D;
- preview is non-selectable and does not intercept pointer events;
- preview is not stored in `Diagram`;
- preview is not exported to TikZ;
- preview is visually distinct from real sheet strata;
- cursor creation works on active custom planes for point/label/polyline/cubic/sheet;
- created vertices lie on the plane;
- created geometry is ordinary `Vec3` data;
- SVG and TikZ update;
- layer/filter/selection behavior preserved;
- direct creation is not broken;
- tests cover creation on custom planes.

If cursor creation ignores custom planes, classify as Medium. If preview intercepts clicks, classify as Medium.

Run verification commands and report results.
