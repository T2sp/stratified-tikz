# Phase 13J Review Prompt: Perspective projection placeholder and camera hardening

## Environment

The default shell may use Node v16.17.0 at `/usr/local/bin/node`.

This project requires Node >=22.12.0.

Use:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Verification:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm test
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH npm run build
```


## Project context

You are working on the StratifiedTikZ project.

Phase 12 is complete. The app supports:

- 2D and 3D diagrams;
- axis-aligned and custom work planes;
- cursor creation and direct creation;
- SVG preview;
- TikZ export;
- save/load;
- undo/redo;
- selection, inspector, layer filtering, and style editing.

Important conventions:

- An `n`-stratum means codimension `n`, not dimension.
- Internally all coordinates are `Vec3`.
- In 2D, `z` is hidden/locked/ignored and should stay `0`.
- Camera/view state is editor/view state unless explicitly persisted as diagram view options.
- Camera/view state is not a stratum.
- Work planes remain model-space geometry.
- Projection/camera and work planes must remain separate concerns.
- Generated TikZ must remain readable.
- Preserve Phase 9A coordinate naming and Phase 9B layer-aware TikZ output.
- Preserve Phase 12 work-plane behavior.


## Review instructions

Review this subphase only.

Do not modify files.

At the end, output both:

1. a human-readable review;
2. a machine-readable JSON block between `REVIEW_JSON_START` and `REVIEW_JSON_END`.

If there are any Critical or Medium issues, set `"ready_to_commit": false`.

If only Low-priority issues remain, set `"ready_to_commit": true`.

Use this human-readable structure:

```markdown
**Summary:** pass / needs changes

**Critical Issues**
- ...

**Medium Issues**
- ...

**Low-Priority Issues**
- ...

**What Looks Correct**
- ...

**Test Results**
...

**Build Results**
...

**Ready To Call This Subphase Complete**
Yes/No, with a short reason.

**Suggested Targeted Follow-Up Prompt**
If needed, provide a concise fix prompt.
```

Then output exactly:

```text
REVIEW_JSON_START
{
  "summary": "pass or needs_changes",
  "critical_count": 0,
  "medium_count": 0,
  "low_count": 0,
  "ready_to_commit": true,
  "suggested_fix_prompt": ""
}
REVIEW_JSON_END
```

Rules:

- counts must be numbers;
- `summary` must be `"pass"` or `"needs_changes"`;
- `ready_to_commit` must be false if Critical or Medium issues exist;
- `suggested_fix_prompt` should be targeted if fixes are needed.


## Goal under review

Phase 13J should harden the camera abstraction for future perspective projection while keeping orthographic camera behavior stable.

## Review checklist

Check:

- orthographic camera behavior unchanged;
- tikz-3dplot theta/phi export unchanged;
- reset-to-initial still works;
- if perspective type exists, unsupported operations fail clearly;
- perspective is not exposed in UI unless functional;
- work-plane picking abstraction remains camera-ray based;
- no half-working perspective projection breaks creation/dragging;
- docs clarify current orthographic status and future perspective plan.

Medium issues include:

- perspective UI exposed but broken;
- orthographic behavior regressed;
- TikZ export switched to unsupported perspective-like output;
- camera abstraction made future perspective harder.

Run verification commands and report results.
